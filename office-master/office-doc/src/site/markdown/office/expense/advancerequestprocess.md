Advance Request Process
=========
 - When an employee submits Advance Requisition Request 
    -  For Associate Employees, the request approval process is sent to the Payroll Department.
    -  For Corporate Employees, the request approval process is sent to the Reporting Manager.
 - If the request is approved, system generates a task to the Admin, to start the final approval process.
 - The requested/approved amount can be updated before the final approval process is complete.

 - If the Advance Requisition Request is rejected, an email with description/reason for denial, is sent to the employee.
