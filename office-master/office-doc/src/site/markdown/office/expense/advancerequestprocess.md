Advance Request Process
=========
 - When an employee submits Advance Requisition Request 
    -  For Associate Employees, the request approval process is sent to the Payroll Department.
    -  For Corporate Employees, the request approval process is sent to the Reporting Manager.
 - If the request is approved, system generates a task to the Admin, to start the final approval process.
 - The requested/approved amount can be updated before the final approval process is complete. 
 - After the final approval process is complete, system generates a task for the Accounts Payable Dept., to schedule payment dispatch.
 - The Accounts Payable team validates and completes the payment process.
