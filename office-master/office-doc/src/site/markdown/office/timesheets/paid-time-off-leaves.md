- Example: A full-time 40 hours-per-week employee with 2 years of service   
- Employee’s current PTO balance is 132 hours
- 1st payroll accrues 12 hours to reach the annual PTO accrual maximum of 144 hours 
- 2nd  payroll no PTO is taken, so there is no accrual and the balance remains 144 
- 3rd   payroll 40 hours of PTO is taken and the balance becomes 116 (144 hours minus 40 hours = 104 hours plus 12.0 accrual = balance of 116)
