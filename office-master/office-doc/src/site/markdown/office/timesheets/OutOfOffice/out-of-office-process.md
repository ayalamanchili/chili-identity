Remote Work Request Process
-----

- When an employee submits a request, it creates a task for that employee’s Reports_To manager.
- Email is sent to Reports_To manager about the new task, and notification is sent to the employee.
- The Request will be created with **Pending Manager Approval** status.
- The Reports_To manager task will be approved or rejected within 48 hours.
- The employee receives email regarding the status, and the entry in the Status box is changed to Approved or Rejected.
- If the approval or rejection action does not occur within the 48 hours, the manager will receive an email notification regarding the request.
- HR Admin has search capability to view all Remote Work requests.
- The Reports_To manager has search capability for only those employees who are direct reports or otherwise under that manager.
