Managing New Corporate Employee TimeSheets
-----

 Example: 
 ---------
 
  - Lets Say new employee Aarthi Prathap starts on 03/03/2014
  - we need to create two timesheets for Sick Earned and Personal Earned after 2 months of probation ie start date of 05/03/2014 make sure the status is pending rather than Approved.
  - once the start date of the timesheet passes the status will be changed to approved by the system after when the employee can view them as available in summary so they can apply.
