 - At any point the the ownership of the ticket can be changed by updating Department and Assigned To values which triggers email notification and Task updated accordingly.
 - All the communication with regard to the ticket should be made through comments section so its easy to track and audit. Also when any comment or updated made to the ticket a email notification is sent to the entire chain involved.
 - Each ticket type has a Service Level agreement (the default is 7 days) and if the ticket is not resolved within the SLA it will cause a Escalation Task and Email send to Admin along with all parties.
 - Once the ticket is Resolved or Rejected with appropriate comments and notes the Task will automatically be removed from the department queue.
 - The Employee has the option to re open the ticket if he's not satisfied or think the resolution is incomplete and the process repeats.
> **Note:** If the Ticket Type is **Other** it will stay in Engagement Team queue until the actual team responsible is determined and assigned.
